Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data to business insights.
The goal of the project is to clean and analyze a dataset using SQL, visualize key insights using Power BI, and summarize findings in a clear report.

The project showcases skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, data visualization, and analytical reporting.

Dataset

The dataset contains structured data related to business performance (e.g., sales, customers, transactions).

Data was loaded into a PostgreSQL database for analysis.

Raw data included missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats that required cleaning.

(Note: Dataset source can be added here if it is public.)

Tools & Technologies

PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL analysis

SQL – Data cleaning and querying

Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation

Microsoft Excel / CSV – Initial data inspection

Report (PDF/Doc) – Summary of insights and findings

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into a PostgreSQL server.

Verified schema, data types, and table structure.

Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate records.

Handled missing and null values.

Standardized column names and formats.

Validated data consistency.

SQL Analysis

Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.

Performed aggregations, joins, and filtering.

Created views for reusable analysis.

Dashboard Development

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL.

Built interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, and filters.

Focused on clear and recruiter-friendly visuals.

Reporting

Summarized insights, trends, and recommendations.

Explained results in simple, non-technical language.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis over time

Category and regional breakdowns

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders quickly understand performance and make data-driven decisions.

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns in the data.

Highlighted top-performing and underperforming areas.

Provided actionable insights based on SQL analysis and visual findings.

Demonstrated the ability to translate raw data into meaningful business insights.
